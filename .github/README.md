# AwesomeOS
AwesomeOS - AOS Main Repository of the Public Documentation and Parts for Enterprise Ask Frank

AOS is a general-purpose operating system, that can be built with the monolithic Linux kernel, The Mach Micro Kernel, The Zricon Fuchsia OS kernel, or any other Compatible Kernel that has C Binary Interop. Its package system allows you to quickly install, update and remove software; software is provided in binary packages or can be built directly from sources.

It is an independent distribution, developed entirely by Frank at present.

Unlike 99.99% of other existing distros, AwesomeOS is not a modification of an existing distribution. AwesomeOS is the first of Its Kind. As its package manager and build system Implementation, Unlike most Other distros, is independent it has no Affiliation to any of the Big Main Distros while our tooling works with any Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, Fuchsia, LaCroOS, BSD, or Distribution.

focuses on stability, while being bleeding-edge. Install once, update routinely and safely.
Thanks to our continuous linear world wide build grid, new software is built into world wide accessible shared Memory exposed as Handels as soon as the changes are saved. This allows you to Realtime iterate over your code while adopting changes to production only after everything is fully tested and works as expected. Without Additional Deployment!

We Implemented highly Generic APIs for any need so that you got a Stable Platform where you can build and run your software on. No matter what workloads you targeting or if it is an IoT Device. Software Management is fully Handled by AwesomeOS 

The AwesomeOS Gui is Implemented in HTML CSS and Nativ ASM. Offering Scripting and Integration Support via ECMAScript and C++

- The B8G Compiler Framework. If you want to create the next generation of Highly Efficient Services.
- The Stealify Lang Framework. If you want to Implement your own DSL or Instruction Procedural Language give it a shot.
- The Web Virtual Environments WVE Framework. If you want to Deploy use and maybe even improve the next generation of Containerised Workloads and System Emulation directly in any WInterOP Compatible Environment you found the right place.
  - Chromium Virtual Environments ChromiumVE is the First Implementation of this using the Chromium API all others get generated out of that.
