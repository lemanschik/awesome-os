# Chromium - Virtual Environments
This Includes the Chromium Virtual Environments B8G Tooling and Integrations. 
The Main B8G Project depends partial on parts of the Chromium Platform like V8 which is largly used by B8G to compile its own Binarys.

## Goals
WebRTC Driven Realtime Updating World Wide Build Grid for Chromium Developers. Using the opfs.zip and cloud-fs.zip Platform offerings.
Or the Software Stacks which are downloadable as Unlicense Software and self host them. 

Both Stacks do run Completly in any WInterOP Powered Environment even Cloudflare Workers.

The OPFS Stack is a Universal Filesystem Exchange origin Implementation designed to Manage Environments Settings and Secrets as also IAM 
in a Central Place with git like features that are also fully git compatible.

Cloud FS is a WebRTC Based Framework and Integration to connect a OPFS Enabled Origins to a other Remote File System on one or many servers fully distributed. 

## How?
This uses the Newst Archivements of the Open Source Community like Project FUGU and Others. And Integrates them Into Something usable.
In Real World Scenarios. This AIMS not less then to get a Real Life Example of a World Wide Distributed Super Computer that can build and run Chromium Platform Components fully Isolated Containered in Virtual Machines that do run in the Browser or any WInterOP Environment.
