# git-subrepo 
Git Subrepo is a bit like git submodules but it is a implementation with focus on total integration and adoption.

The Git SubRepo pattern is designed to form a single Global Repositiory with Authoritiv Permissions. 
So it is not designed mainly to update existing sources in the repositorys that it clones.

It Can! But the flow is optimized as sayed to be Authoritiv that means the source repo gets used
to ingest changes if needed and apply own changes to it. So it is mainly the core driver
of our Distributed world wide build grid. As that is not designed to contribute back while still
ingesting changes from legacy git repositorys.
