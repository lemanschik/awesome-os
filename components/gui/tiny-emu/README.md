# A TinyEMU GUI Implementation 
This is a tribute to Fabrice Bellard's wonderfull work and research in the fild of wasm System Emulation.

He was highly Inspiring and even Mentoring me via its Code Projects. It helped me also a lot that he linked
his research sources in a followable way. This man is definitly Part of the AwesomeOS Core Project and even
the concepts and ideas.
