# Offers educational guidiance to replace aws with aos
Amazon Cloud Services are a WebDriven mainly REST API Based Services
That do offer Web and CLI (Shell) Interfaces and Integrations

To Instances and Services running on the Amazon Cloud. 

While Amazon Cloud offers Excelent Services in terms of Quality.
It can get fast expensive and hard to calculate costs.

AwesomeOS is designed to reduce exactly such costs. And you can still run on AWS
and depend on the Service Quality without paying to much for your deployments.

As AwesomeOS gives your Applications the Power of the Quarternion SDK which allows you
to Deploy Programable Realtime Memory Grids. That are Link able via WebRTC. 

You can form hadoop like workload processing clusters in a genric generativ way.

The Fundamentals of linear Linked Memory Grid Computing allow your applications to 
execute linear predictable distributed over time. AwesomeOS is a Implementation
based on this Fundamentals all software that is used with it gets used and integrated
via the same concepts and patterns all over.

So to make it short. You can Simple buy Amazon Pre Payed Instances to save money
as you can execute any workloads on them with the same methods. No Matter if you want to do 
lambda like flows or Monolithic Horizontal Scalability. 

AwesomeOS has Data Distribution Solved for you by design. Quarternion offers a Modular Composable
set of Sync API's and Patterns to Distribute and directly use the data after it is loaded so it 
can linear add computation and processing capabilitys to your data directly. With and Without 
Copying or Moving data. So it is a buldIn Data Lake Implementation. And full S3 Compatible 
via cloud-fs.zip which offers s3 api's you can even replace whole s3 endpoints with cloud-fs endpoints
or opfs.zip endpoints to speed up your distribution and development workflows while still syncing
as fallback or backup or additional public or private seed source to aws s3.

Or Maybe your a Cloud Provider that wants to resell aws services in a transprent way and whitelabel.

All this is no problem with AwesomeOS's design.
