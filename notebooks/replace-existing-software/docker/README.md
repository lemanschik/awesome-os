# Replace Docker with AwesomeOS
As AwesomeOS offers all capabilitys that Docker / LibContainer offers including the wasm capabilitys and even via B8G own Compiler
Capabilitys AwesomeOS is a More Secure Container Execution Environment then LibContainer as it does not depend on
the legacy implementations and does not contain its bloat and concepts.

see: ../podman/README.md for podman and docker-podman same applys.
